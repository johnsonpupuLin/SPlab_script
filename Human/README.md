# Instruction

Is's a series of small RNA-seq analysis in SP lab.
I will briefly describe the general flow and the function of scripts in below section.

I might update some scripts of other analysis in the future.


# Small RNA-seq

## General Flow

In general, the analysis is carried out in below order.
There are different scripts in those directories.

### 1. pipeline

In this step, you will map your sequencing data to genome.

There are two pipelines. One is Tophat2-based and is constructed by SP lab members. The other one is HTseq-based and is from Diana's lab, mimiced from their paper.

* human_pipeline.sh

This is SP lab pipeline.


* Diana_HTseq_pipeline.sh

### 2. counting

3. piRNA_character_analysis

4. piRNA_cluster_analysis
