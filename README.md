# For Beginners
If you are a beginner of using linux and learngin bioinformatics.
Please read the file "basic_command" first. (wrote in Traditional Chinese)
It might take some time and be frustrated to get used to linux.
However, it is not so difficult actually.
You just need some practicing.


# For whom who is ready to start running some script.
It's the scripts from SP Lin's lab, collected and organized by HHL.
That is, most of these scripts have beed used and modified by myself.

At the time point I constructed this repository, most of the analysis focused on human fetal gonad.
Therefore, large part of scripts are included in "human" directory.
However, if you are already familiar with linux, you can just modify the path of input and reference, then the script could be applied to other species.

To a certain extent, this repository is only a backup for the script I've used before.
It is willing to download those scripts and modify by yourself.

If you have any question, you can try to contact me.
If I still remember how they work, I will try my best to solve your question.
