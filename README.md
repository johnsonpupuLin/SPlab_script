## Greeting! If you are here, it might due to the requirements from Prof. SP, asking you to start to learn bioinformatics or search for some former scripts.

## Please note the following instructions.


# For Beginners
If you are a beginner of operating Linux and learning bioinformatics, please read the file "basic_tutorial" first. (wrote in Traditional Chinese)

It is a file to help you get used to operating Linux, containing some initial knowledge such as logging in server and basic command.


After you basically understand how Linux work, please read the file "advanced_tutorial". (wrote in Tranditional Chinese)

It conntains some necessary skill and some of my notes for running scripts and analyzing our lab data.


It might take some time.
However, it is not so difficult actually.
You just need some practicing.


# For whom that is ready to start running some script.
It's the scripts from SP Lin's lab, collected and organized by HHL.
That is, most of these scripts have beed used and modified by myself.


At the time point I constructed this repository, most of the analysis focused on human fetal gonad.
Therefore, large part of scripts are included in "human" directory.
However, if you are already familiar with linux, you can just modify the path of input and reference, then the script could be applied to other species.


To a certain extent, this repository is only a backup for the script I've used before.
It is willing to download those scripts and modify by yourself.


If you have any question, you can try to contact me.
If I still remember how they work, I will try my best to solve your question.
